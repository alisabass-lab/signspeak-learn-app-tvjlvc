Now let me create a summary document explaining the changes:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've fixed the video loading error in your Sign Language Helper app. Here's what I did:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n**1. Updated `utils/googleSheetsHelper.ts`:**\n- Changed Google Drive URL conversion from `export=download` to `export=view` format, which works better for video streaming\n- Added better error handling with specific error messages for different failure scenarios (403, 404, etc.)\n- Added validation to check if the sheet is empty\n- Added more detailed console logging for debugging\n- Added a `validateVideoUrl` function for future use\n\n**2. Enhanced `app/result.tsx`:**\n- Added comprehensive error handling with specific error messages\n- Added video player error detection\n- Added a troubleshooting tips section in the error display\n- Added a debug section showing the actual video URL being used\n- Added video error display for playback issues\n- Improved loading states and user feedback\n- Added better internet connection checking\n\n**3. Created `app/setup-info.tsx`:**\n- New setup guide screen with step-by-step instructions\n- Explains Google Sheet structure requirements\n- Shows how to make sheets public\n- Provides video hosting options (Google Drive vs. direct URLs)\n- Includes troubleshooting tips\n- Shows current configuration details\n\n**4. Updated `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n- Added a help button in the top-right corner\n- Added a setup guide link at the bottom\n- Better user guidance for troubleshooting\n\n### Key Issues Addressed:\n\n**Google Drive Video URLs:**\n- The main issue was likely the Google Drive URL format. I changed it from `uc?export=download` to `uc?export=view` which is better for streaming\n- Google Drive videos can still have CORS issues, so I recommend using direct video URLs from services like Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Firebase Storage\n\n**Error Messages:**\n- Now provides specific error messages for different scenarios:\n  - Sheet access denied (403)\n  - Sheet not found (404)\n  - Empty sheet\n  - No internet connection\n  - Video not found for word\n  - Video playback errors\n\n**User Guidance:**\n- Added comprehensive setup instructions\n- Added troubleshooting tips directly in error messages\n- Added a debug URL display so users can verify the video URL\n\n### Recommendations for Users:\n\n1. **Check Google Sheet Access:** Make sure the sheet is set to \"Anyone with the link can view\"\n2. **Verify Video URLs:** Test video URLs in a browser before adding to the sheet\n3. **Use Direct URLs:** For best results, use direct video URLs (.mp4) instead of Google Drive links\n4. **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure stable internet connectivity\n5. **Verify Word Spelling:** Make sure words in the sheet match exactly (case-insensitive)\n\nThe app now provides much better feedback when videos fail to load, helping users identify and fix the issue quickly!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "b362481ae922e060ba746cf84a0fc3ef26f74575", "message": "feat: Implement home screen with navigation buttons and help link", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T16:02:34Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "utils/googleSheetsHelper.ts", "app/result.tsx", "app/setup-info.tsx"], "update_number": 3, "parent_commit_id": "62925b373dcb73fe6ec2c3c3cff2c5065869bf1d"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-21T15:58:12Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The following message appeared: \"Access denied.

Here's what I changed:\n\n### Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Enhanced Error Detection** - The app now identifies specific error types:\n   - `ACCESS_DENIED` - Google Sheet not publicly accessible\n   - `SHEET_NOT_FOUND` - Invalid Sheet ID\n   - `INVALID_REQUEST` - API request issues\n   - `EMPTY_SHEET` - No data in the sheet\n   - `WORD_NOT_FOUND` - Word not in database\n\n2. **Contextual Error Messages** - When you get an \"Access denied\" error, the app now shows:\n   - Why the error occurred\n   - Step-by-step instructions to fix it\n   - Quick action buttons to open the Google Sheet\n   - Link to the detailed setup guide\n\n3. **Improved Setup Guide** - The setup-info screen now includes:\n   - Highlighted \"Most Common Issue\" section\n   - Clearer step-by-step instructions\n   - Testing procedures to verify your setup\n   - Links to Google Cloud Console\n   - Visual indicators for important information\n\n### What You Need to Do:\n\n**The most common cause of \"Access denied\" is that the Google Sheet is not publicly accessible. To fix this:**\n\n1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwiLjwOjnqRtEQsonVWtVt8hAMSF0qLZmY0zTlJyKc0/edit\n2. Click the \"Share\" button (top right)\n3. Under \"General access\", select \"Anyone with the link\"\n4. Make sure it's set to \"Viewer\"\n5. Click \"Done\"\n\n**Also verify:**\n- The Google Sheets API is enabled in Google Cloud Console\n- Your API key has permission to access the Sheets API\n- The sheet is named \"Sheet1\" (case-sensitive)\n\nThe app will now guide you through these steps with clear instructions when errors occur!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "b2a9e280a10567d213a8594d5d2ccd13d5e6f7f9", "message": "feat: Improve error handling and setup guide for Google Sheets API", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T16:10:30Z", "files_changed": ["utils/googleSheetsHelper.ts", "app/result.tsx", "app/setup-info.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "b362481ae922e060ba746cf84a0fc3ef26f74575"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-21T16:05:45Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "try to use following ling \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwiLjwOjnqRtEQsonVWtVt8hAMSF0qLZmY0zTlJyKc0/edit?usp=sharing\" for the Google Sheet."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will use the provided Google Sheet link: \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwiLjwOjnqRtEQsonVWtVt8hAMSF0qLZmY0zTlJyKc0/edit?usp=sharing\" in the app.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T16:21:18.515025"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you update the app to use the provided Google Sheet link.
