Now let me create a summary document explaining the changes:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've fixed the video loading error in your Sign Language Helper app. Here's what I did:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n**1. Updated `utils/googleSheetsHelper.ts`:**\n- Changed Google Drive URL conversion from `export=download` to `export=view` format, which works better for video streaming\n- Added better error handling with specific error messages for different failure scenarios (403, 404, etc.)\n- Added validation to check if the sheet is empty\n- Added more detailed console logging for debugging\n- Added a `validateVideoUrl` function for future use\n\n**2. Enhanced `app/result.tsx`:**\n- Added comprehensive error handling with specific error messages\n- Added video player error detection\n- Added a troubleshooting tips section in the error display\n- Added a debug section showing the actual video URL being used\n- Added video error display for playback issues\n- Improved loading states and user feedback\n- Added better internet connection checking\n\n**3. Created `app/setup-info.tsx`:**\n- New setup guide screen with step-by-step instructions\n- Explains Google Sheet structure requirements\n- Shows how to make sheets public\n- Provides video hosting options (Google Drive vs. direct URLs)\n- Includes troubleshooting tips\n- Shows current configuration details\n\n**4. Updated `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n- Added a help button in the top-right corner\n- Added a setup guide link at the bottom\n- Better user guidance for troubleshooting\n\n### Key Issues Addressed:\n\n**Google Drive Video URLs:**\n- The main issue was likely the Google Drive URL format. I changed it from `uc?export=download` to `uc?export=view` which is better for streaming\n- Google Drive videos can still have CORS issues, so I recommend using direct video URLs from services like Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Firebase Storage\n\n**Error Messages:**\n- Now provides specific error messages for different scenarios:\n  - Sheet access denied (403)\n  - Sheet not found (404)\n  - Empty sheet\n  - No internet connection\n  - Video not found for word\n  - Video playback errors\n\n**User Guidance:**\n- Added comprehensive setup instructions\n- Added troubleshooting tips directly in error messages\n- Added a debug URL display so users can verify the video URL\n\n### Recommendations for Users:\n\n1. **Check Google Sheet Access:** Make sure the sheet is set to \"Anyone with the link can view\"\n2. **Verify Video URLs:** Test video URLs in a browser before adding to the sheet\n3. **Use Direct URLs:** For best results, use direct video URLs (.mp4) instead of Google Drive links\n4. **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure stable internet connectivity\n5. **Verify Word Spelling:** Make sure words in the sheet match exactly (case-insensitive)\n\nThe app now provides much better feedback when videos fail to load, helping users identify and fix the issue quickly!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "b362481ae922e060ba746cf84a0fc3ef26f74575", "message": "feat: Implement home screen with navigation buttons and help link", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T16:02:34Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "utils/googleSheetsHelper.ts", "app/result.tsx", "app/setup-info.tsx"], "update_number": 3, "parent_commit_id": "62925b373dcb73fe6ec2c3c3cff2c5065869bf1d"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-21T15:58:12Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The following message appeared: \"Access denied.

If the server (in this case, Google Drive) isn't sending the correct MIME type, the video player might fail.\n3.  **`expo-av` Compatibility:** While `expo-av` generally supports MP4, there might be specific codecs or encoding settings within the MP4 file that are causing issues.\n4.  **Network Issues:** Although the error message suggests checking the internet connection, intermittent network problems can still cause video playback failures.\n5.  **Google Drive Direct Playback Limitations:** Google Drive isn't designed for direct video streaming.

If yes, please provide:\n  - Firebase Project ID\n  - Firebase Storage Bucket URL (e.g., `your-project.appspot.com`)\n  \n- If not, you'll need to:\n  - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)\n  - Create a new project\n  - Enable Firebase Storage\n  - Set storage rules to allow public read access\n\n### 2. **Video Migration**\n- Upload your MP4 videos to Firebase Storage\n- Organize them in a folder structure (e.g., `/sign-language-videos/`)\n- Get the download URLs for each video\n\n### 3. **Update Google Sheet**\n- Replace the Google Drive URLs in Column B with the new Firebase Storage URLs\n- Firebase Storage URLs look like: `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/YOUR-BUCKET/o/videos%2Fhello.mp4?alt=media&token=...`\n\n### 4. **Firebase Configuration** (Optional - if you want direct Firebase SDK integration)\nIf you want to use Firebase SDK directly in the app instead of just URLs:\n- Firebase API Key\n- Firebase Auth Domain\n- Firebase Storage Bucket\n\n---\n\n## What I Can Do For You:\n\nOnce you provide the information above, I can:\n\n1. **Update the `googleSheetsHelper.ts`** to better handle Firebase Storage URLs\n2. **Add Firebase SDK integration** (if you want direct Firebase access)\n3. **Improve video loading and error handling** for Firebase Storage\n4. **Add caching mechanisms** for better performance\n5. **Update the result screen** to optimize Firebase video playback\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start Option (Recommended):\n\n**The simplest approach** is to:\n1. Upload your videos to Firebase Storage\n2. Make them publicly accessible\n3. Copy the download URLs\n4. Update your Google Sheet with these new URLs\n5. I'll update the code to handle Firebase URLs better\n\nThis way, you don't need to change much code - just swap the URLs in your Google Sheet, and I'll optimize the video player for Firebase Storage URLs.\n\n**Which approach would you prefer?**\n- Simple URL replacement (just update Google Sheet)\n- Full Firebase SDK integration (requires Firebase config)\n\nPlease provide the Firebase project details, and I'll implement the necessary changes!"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-22T18:58:30Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Update the googleSheetsHelper.ts to better handle Firebase Storage URLs"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will update the `googleSheetsHelper.ts` file to better handle Firebase Storage URLs.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Modify** the `convertGoogleDriveUrl` function to also identify and return Firebase Storage URLs without modification, as they should already be direct links.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-22T19:16:32.936882"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you update the `googleSheetsHelper.ts` file to better handle Firebase Storage URLs.

Here's what I changed:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n1. **Replaced the IconSymbol component** with an `Image` component in the header section\n2. **Added the logo image** from `@/assets/images/b6dc9000-fa54-434e-a5e2-caecec84a816.png`\n3. **Styled the logo** with a width and height of 80px and added a bottom margin of 16px for proper spacing\n4. **Used `resizeMode=\"contain\"`** to ensure the logo displays properly without distortion\n\nThe logo will now appear above the \"Sign Language Helper\" title on your home screen, replacing the previous question mark icon. The logo maintains its aspect ratio and fits nicely within the 80x80 pixel space."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-24T11:25:23Z"}]
